Hello, it's me
I was wondering if after all these years you'd like to meet
To go over everything
They say that time's supposed to heal ya, but I ain't done much healing
Hello, can you hear me?
I'm in California dreaming about who we used to be
When we were younger and free
I've forgotten how it felt before the world fell at our feet
There's such a difference between us
And a million miles
Hello from the other side
I must've called a thousand times
To tell you I'm sorry for everything that I've done
But when I call, you never seem to be home
Hello from the outside
At least I can say that I've tried
To tell you I'm sorry for breaking your heart
But it don't matter, it clearly doesn't tear you apart anymore
Hello, how are you?
It's so typical of me to talk about myself, I'm sorry
I hope that you're well
Did you ever make it out of that town where nothing ever happened?
It's no secret that the both of us
Are running out of time
So hello from the other side (other side)
I must've called a thousand times (thousand times)
To tell you I'm sorry for everything that I've done
But when I call, you never seem to be home
Hello from the outside (outside)
At least I can say that I've tried (I've tried)
To tell you I'm sorry for breaking your heart
But it don't matter, it clearly doesn't tear you apart anymore
Ooh (lows, lows, lows, lows), anymore
(Highs, highs, highs, highs)
Ooh (lows, lows, lows, lows), anymore
(Highs, highs, highs, highs)
Ooh (lows, lows, lows, lows), anymore
(Highs, highs, highs, highs)
Anymore (lows, lows, lows, lows)
Hello from the other side (other side)
I must've called a thousand times (thousand times)
To tell you I'm sorry for everything that I've done
But when I call, you never seem to be home
Hello from the outside (outside)
At least I can say that I've tried (I've tried)
To tell you I'm sorry for breaking your heart
But it don't matter, it clearly doesn't tear you apart anymore







Okay, okay, I see what's happening here
You're face to face with greatness, and it's strange
You don't even know how you feel
It's adorable
Well, it's nice to see that humans never change
Open your eyes, let's begin
Yes, it's really me, it's Maui
Breathe it in
I know it's a lot
The hair, the bod
When you're staring at a demi-god
What can I say except, "You're welcome"
For the tides, the sun, the sky
Hey, it's okay, it's okay
You're welcome
I'm just an ordinary demi-guy
Hey
What has two thumbs and pulled up the sky
When you were waddling yea high?
This guy
When the nights got cold
Who stole you fire from down below?
You're lookin' at him, yo
Oh, also I lassoed the sun
You're welcome
To stretch your days and bring you fun
Also I harnessed the breeze
You're welcome
To fill your sails and shake your trees
So what can I say except you're welcome
For the islands I pulled from the sea
There's no need to pray, it's okay
You're welcome
Ha, I guess it's just my way of being me
You're welcome
You're welcome
Well, come to think of it
Kid, honestly I could go on and on
I could explain every natural phenomenon
The tide, the grass, the ground
Oh, that was Maui just messing around
I killed an eel
I buried its guts
Sprouted a tree, now you got coconuts
What's the lesson?
What is the take-away?
Don't mess with Maui when he's on a break-away
And the tapestry here on my skin
Is a map of the victories I win
Look where I've been
I make everything happen
Look at that mean mini-Maui just tickety-tappin'
(Ha ha ha ha ha ha, hey)
Well, anyway let me say, "You're welcome" (you're welcome)
For the wonderful world you know
Hey, it's okay, it's okay, you're welcome (you're welcome)
Well, come to think of it, I gotta go (hey)
Hey, it's your day to say, "You're welcome" (you're welcome)
'Cause I'm gonna need that boat
I'm sailing away, away, you're welcome (you're welcome)
'Cause Maui can do anything but float
You're welcome
(You're welcome)
You're welcome
And thank you

Ma-ia-hoo, ma-ia-haa
Ma-ia-hii, ma-ia-huu
Ma-ia-hoo, ma-ia-haa

Alo, salut, sunt eu un haiduc
Si te rog iubirea mea primeste fericirea
Alo, alo, sunt eu, Picasso
Ti-am dat beep si sunt voinic
Dar sa stii nu-ti cer nimic
Vrei sa pleci dar nu ma nu ma iei
Nu ma nu ma iei, nu ma nu ma nu ma iei
Chipul tau si dragostea din tei
Mi-amintesc de ochii tai
Vrei sa pleci dar nu ma nu ma iei
Nu ma nu ma iei, nu ma nu ma nu ma iei
Chipul tau si dragostea din tei
Mi-amintesc de ochii tai
Te sun sa-ti spun ce simt acum
Alo, iubirea mea sunt eu fericirea
Alo, alo, sunt iarasi eu, Picasso
Ti-am dat beep si sunt voinic
Dar sa stii nu-ti cer nimic
Vrei sa pleci dar nu ma nu ma iei
Nu ma nu ma iei, nu ma nu ma nu ma iei
Chipul tau si dragostea din tei
Mi-amintesc de ochii tai
Vrei sa pleci dar nu ma nu ma iei
Nu ma nu ma iei, nu ma nu ma nu ma iei
Chipul tau si dragostea din tei
Mi-amintesc de ochii tai
Ma-ia-hii, ma-ia-huu
Ma-ia-hoo, ma-ia-haa
Ma-ia-hii, ma-ia-huu
Ma-ia-hoo, ma-ia-haa
Ma-ia-hii, ma-ia-huu
Ma-ia-hoo, ma-ia-haa
Ma-ia-hii, ma-ia-huu
Ma-ia-hoo, ma-ia-haa
Vrei sa pleci dar nu ma nu ma iei
Nu ma nu ma iei, nu ma nu ma nu ma iei
Chipul tau si dragostea din tei
Mi-amintesc de ochii tai
Vrei sa pleci dar nu ma nu ma iei
Nu ma nu ma iei, nu ma nu ma nu ma iei
Chipul tau si dragostea din tei
Mi-amintesc de ochii tai
